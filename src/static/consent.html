      <p>You are being invited to participate in a research study titled
      “Crowdsourced Software Engineering using Gamification”. This study is
      being done by Professor Sorin Lerner, Professor William G. Griswold,
      Graduate Student Dimitar Bounov and Graduate Student Anthony DeRossi
      from the University of California - San Diego (UCSD).</p>

      <p>The purpose of this research study is to understand if Software
      Engineering tasks can be performed by users playing online games. If you
      agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to play several
      levels of an online game, and complete an online survey. The entire task
      should take you about 20 minutes to complete. There will be
      approximately 1,000 participants in this study.</p>

      <p>There may or may not be any direct benefit to you from this research.
      If there is a benefit to you, it could be that: (1) you may find the
      game fun to play (2) you may get the satisfaction of contributing to a
      “citizen sciences” project. The investigator(s), however, may learn more
      about how Software Engineering tasks can be performed through online
      games.</p>

      <p>You will be paid $10/hour for participating in this study.</p>

      <p>There are minimal risks associated with this research study. One
      risk is the potential for fatigue or frustration while playing the game.
      Although our ultimate goal is to provide a fun game to play, you may
      still find the online game frustrating. You can stop the study at any
      point, and we will have a “Quit” button prominently displayed at all
      times during the game.</p>

      <p>Another risk is the potential for the loss of confidentiality.
      The data we collect about you will remain confidential. We will
      remove all personally identifiable information in the data, specifically
      your Mechanical Turk Worker ID and your Internet Protocol (IP) Address.
      We will only use your Mechanical Turk Worker ID to process payments that
      are due to you, after which we will remove it from our data. Under no
      circumstances will we make your Mechanical Turk Worker ID or IP address
      publicly available.</p>

      <p>Research records will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by
      law and may be reviewed by the UCSD Institutional Review Board.</p>

      <p>Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you can
      withdraw at any time by simply quitting the game. You can also skip any
      questions in the survey. Choosing not to participate or withdrawing will
      result in no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled.</p>

      <p>If you have questions about this project or if you have a
      research-related problem, you may contact the researcher(s), Sorin
      Lerner (lerner@cs.ucsd.edu) and William G. Griswold (wgg@cs.ucsd.edu).
      If you have any questions concerning your rights as a research subject,
      you may contact the UCSD Human Research Protections Program Office at
      1-858-246-HRPP (1-858-246-4777).</p>

      least 18 years old, have read this consent form, and agree to
      participate in this research study. You may print a copy of this page
